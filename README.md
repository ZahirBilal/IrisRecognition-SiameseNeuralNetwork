# IrisRecognition-SiameseNeuralNetwork

In this project we propose a various of nueral networks architicture for Iris recognition
We performed a one-shot multiple-ways (2, 4, 8, 16) learning on an IRIS images dataset.

Dataset used for training and testing: MMUII
Dataset used for further tesging: UBIRIS v2.0

please check the script, the presentation and the report in the data_script branch for more details.
